Problem statement : Deliver A is a popular food delivery service that is used by many consumers throughout North America . However there is a lot of competition Delivery X, Delivery Y , Delivery Z. 

Lets say that you are the lead Product Manager for Delivery A and you are responsible for delivering latest feature that will provide the largest amount of value to Delivery A and its consumers


Clarifying questions : What is our target increasing the consumer base ,increasing the order value of existing customers or both . Lets assume both . 
1. What does the market share for the existing customer base look like . 
2.Is there a concern for dropping in new customer , activation , average orders per customer , average value per order , revenue 

User Personas : New customer who don't know about the Deliver A , existing customer (how has idea but are not frequent visitors mostly students ) , loyal customers
Delivery partner , Restaurant chains (are all restaurant chains partnered with Deliver A). 
Our target audience : A , existing customer (how has idea but are not frequent visitors )

User Research : Have a loyalty program for both users and restaurant chains example : For user if you have order 10 times a month you get 5 dollar credit and free food delivery for the month . Restaurant - if there are 100 five star rating then we will add your restaurant is recommendation list first in the app . 
1. Schedule reminder for balanced diet foods , Scheduled delivery in case of class/ busy schedule etc
2. 1 dollar food accessible to only students ( customer base is very large )

We are going to prioritize - existing customers who are not very frequent visitors , we can introduce loyalty programs for students and have 1 dollar food in case they miss dinner / during exams etc
